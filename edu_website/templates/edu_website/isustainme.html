        <h2>Why Educator Wellness Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Teaching is a demanding profession that requires immense dedication. However, educators often neglect their own needs 
            in their pursuit to nurture others. <strong>iSustainme</strong> provides a framework for self-care that ensures educators 
            maintain balance, resilience, and sustained motivation.
